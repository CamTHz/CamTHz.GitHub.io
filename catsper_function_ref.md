# CaTSper Processing Steps: A Detailed Description

## Time Domain Analysis

The time delay $\Delta t$ is the extra time needed for the THz pulse to traverse through the sample thickness $H$, compared to the THz pulse traversing the same thickness in the reference measurement (air, refractive index $n_a = 1$). The effective refractive index $n_{eff}$ of the sample is thus calculated by

$$ n_{eff} = \frac{\Delta t c}{H} + 1 $$

where $c$ is the speed of light with a value of $3 \times 10^8$ ms $^{-1}$.
