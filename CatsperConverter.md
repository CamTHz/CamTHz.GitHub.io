# cambridgeTHzconverter Tutorial

## Introduction
This page gives detailed guidance to use the "cambridgeTHzconverter". The input will be the raw data generated by the terahertz spectrometer software. As an example to this documentation, the author uses ".tprj" file generated by the Terapulse 4000 as an example. The output ".thz" file will be an essential input to the "Catsper".

This tool provides an platform to collate the raw sample and reference waveform(s) into a single standardised .thz file. Additional metadata is captured in this file, including, for example, sample thickness, temperature or other contextual information.

When the user lunches the cambridgeTHzconverter, the following UI will display:

## Load the raw dataset
Catsper will read the .mat file created by the App “Catsper MAT Converter” who read the h5d format data generated by the terahertz instrument. In this example, the Terapulse 4000 (Teraview) spectrometer record the data in the .tprj document. The user needs to convert the raw data set into this .mat file in the first place.

Click the “IMPORT PROJECT(S)” button to browse the folder and select the raw data file for conversion. The selected document’s name will appear in the textbox without the suffix. Then choose the “TDS Instrument” that records the dataset. The current version only supports “TeraPulse 4000_UCAM” whilst the rest will be updated in subsequent releases.

Click the “CONVERT DATA” button and the App will read the raw data. A message “Loading…” followed by the “…%” will appear at the upper right corner showing the extent of conversion.

When the conversion finishes, the message “Conversion Complete” will appear and the data will be recorded in arrays shown at the centre panel. User can check if the data have been correctly converted in this panel.

## Save the .mat file
If the user wants to keep the data, simply press the “EXPORT M FILE” button and choose the folder path where the .mat file will be stored. The .mat file contains a 16*[number of waveforms recorded] array of data named “Tcell”.

## Convert another dataset
Press the “CLEAR MEMORY” button in the first instance and confirm this action in the message shown. Then follow the procedure in the Load the raw dataset section to load another raw data file into the converter.

## Load extra datasets for CSV file
The terahertz instrument might not record, e.g., the thickness of the sample (mm) and temperature (K) at which the measurements were undertaken. The converter allows user to import these data from .csv file into the converted datasets (rows #9 and #10). Click the “Thickness” or “Temperature” button at the bottom left corner to choose the .csv file.

## Load the converted dataset (.mat file)
Occasionally, the user might export the converted dataset without the thickness and temperature data. The “IMPORT M FILE” button enables the user to load back the converted .mat file into the converter and add extra data following the procedure outlined in the Load extra datasets for CSV file section. This functionality can also be used to check the .mat file.
